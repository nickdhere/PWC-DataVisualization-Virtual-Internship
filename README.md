# PWC-DataVisualization-Virtual-Internship
## üìã Introduction
This GitHub repository showcases the processes and outcomes of the tasks undertaken during the PwC Switzerland PowerBI Virtual Case Experience, developed in collaboration with Forage. 
The aim of this virtual internship is to emulate the work environment of PwC Switzerland's Digital Accelerator team, with a particular focus on harnessing the capabilities of Power BI.

All the .pbix files and insights presented here are the submissions I made during this program, except for the data files which were assigned by PwC Switzerland.

Virtual Case Experience

## üìå Scenario
At PwC, our mission is to collaborate with global organizations and equip our 276,000 employees with the skills needed to thrive in the digital world. 
We aspire to offer every member of our team the opportunity to learn, work, and actively participate in the digital realm. We enable our employees to become "Digital Accelerators" 
by rapidly advancing their expertise in digital specialties such as data analysis, automation, AI, and digital storytelling. This journey involves mastering self-service tools and 
coding languages and applying these newfound skills across our diverse range of business projects. Your mentor, Giulia, will guide you through your PowerBI skill enhancement journey. 
By the end, you'll emerge as a data Jedi and a full-fledged Digital Accelerator. You've already received a communication from an important client who seeks your expertise in 
visualizing their data.

This virtual experience program comprises three key tasks:

### Task 1: Develop a Call Centre Dashboard - Visualize customer and agent behavior.
Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agent‚Äôs performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

### Task 2: Create Customer Retention Models and Predict Churn - Visualize customer demographics and insights.
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don‚Äôt want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk
We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it‚Äôs self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

### Task 3: Establish Diversity and Inclusion in HR - Visualize gender balance in the executive suite.
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They‚Äôve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they‚Äôre not seeing any progress. They‚Äôre reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

number of men
number of women
number of leavers
% employees promoted (FY21)
% of women promoted
% of hires men
% of hires women
% turnover
Average performance rating: men
Average Performance rating: women
